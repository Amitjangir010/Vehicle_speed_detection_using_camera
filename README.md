Calibration Instructions
To calibrate the speed factor for accurate speed calculations, follow these steps:

1)Record a video of vehicles moving at a known constant speed on a straight road. Ensure that the speed is consistent and measurable.

2)Process the video through the system and note the calculated average speeds for the vehicles.

3)Compare the calculated speeds with the known real-world speeds.

4)Adjust the "speed factor" in the main.py code based on the comparison results until the calculated average speeds align closely with the real-world speeds.
